# TonatonScrap
This a python web scrapping application that reads information from html doc (website),
In this Case http://www.tonaton.com -> arguably the biggest E-Commerce website in Ghana.

My Perculiar target in this program is the electronics category
and from the run() method I can pass items I need and the price range desired. Example 
run("Samsung Phone", 800.00). I get system notification anything there is a new update from my seach result.
